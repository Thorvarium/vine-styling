To change vine styles you can install a browser extensions that inject CSS for you automatically every time that a page load.

# PC
A popular one for desktop (PC) on chrome and firefox is called stylebot, but you can use any extension that supports css injection.
Install with the links below depending on your browser:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en-US

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylebot-web/

- Open stylebot options and go to the tab "Styles"
- Click at "Add a new style..."
- in the "Enter URL..." field use: ```https://*.amazon.com/vine*```
- in the text area below insert the styles that you desire:
```
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/small-items.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-header.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-footer.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-suggestions.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-associate-header.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/more-description-text.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/etv-modal-on-top.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/categories-with-emojis.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/pagination-on-top.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/collapsable-categories.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/striped-categories.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/ghost-limited-availability.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/rfy-afa-ai-tabs.css);

```
Those are the public styles that we created, if you don't want all of them you can remove the line that represents the functionality that you do not want.
For example ```@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/pagination-on-top.css);``` makes the pagination to be on the top of the page, just don't include this line if you dont want that.

## Customization
if you want to customize some specific style you can also open the files that you want to customize, copy the part that you want changed and include at the bottom of the stylebot file. This way you can tweak the numbers that you want customized.

Example:

```
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/small-items.css);
/* ... all other imports ... */
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/collapsable-categories.css);

#vvp-items-grid {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill,minmax(75px,auto)) !important;
}

#vvp-items-grid .vvp-item-tile .vvp-item-tile-content {
  width: 75px !important;
}
```
This will make the items even smaller



# Android
For Android, we recommend a browser called "Kiwi Browser", this browser supports extensions. 

(Google chrome does not support extensions on android and firefox only have a limited quantity of extensions)

download: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US&gl=US

Inside kiwi browser you can install "Stylebot" as well

- Download the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/import-android.json here from the github (you can hold your finger on the link and click "Download Link")
- Open stylebot options and go to the tab "Sync" (Tab Styles does not work very well on mobile, not sure why)
- Click on "Import" and select the downloaded file


# iPhone

Both the Safari extension and alternate browser techniques use products from the company Laso Techcnologies Inc. 


## Alternative browser method
For iPhone, we recommend a browser called "Insight Browser", this browser supports extensions. 

download: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insight-browser/id1531407280

(Safari does support extensions, but it also have a limited quantity)

Inside Insight Browser, go to settings and click on:
  - See all Extensions
  - Add a extension
  - Give it any name
  - Change the "IF" condition to: "url matches regex"
  - give it the value: ```^https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/vine``` (in case you use smiles.amazon you can change here the www for smiles)
  - change the "then" condition to "inject Css from URL"
  - use the url: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/mobile.css```

## Safari extension method
There is a downloadable extension for Safari called "Hyperweb" that supports alternate stylesheets.

download: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperweb/id1581824571

docs: https://guide.hyperweb.app

custom css docs: https://guide.hyperweb.app/styling/custom-css/

Hyperweb also works on desktop Mac and PC for Chrome and Firefox. You may determine you prefer the performance of a different browser and extension.

for iOS and iPadOS:
- open the Hyperbrowser app
- follow the instructions to change your settings
- tap "Advanced" in the bottom bar
- tap "Create Local Extension"
- name your customization
- tap + next to New Condition
- tap Condition Type? and select "URL matches RegEx"
- under the "Then" section tap "Add Action"
- aelect "Inject CSS from URL"
- give it the value: ```^https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/vine``` (in case you use smiles.amazon you can change here the www for smiles)
- change the "then" condition to "inject Css from URL"
- use the url: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/mobile.css```

## Additional customizations
Both are limited to custom css hosted from a url, and not css definitions saved in the stylesheets.

However, you can write and host your own overrides to the styles defined in the vine-styling project. You create a .css file. You make the css changes you wish to see. 
Then add an additional Action for your configuration, specifying the URL to your CSS file.

Your hosting choices are up to you, but options include
- dropbox
- Using a file saved in your iCloud drive https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/352163/obtain-a-private-url-to-a-file-in-icloud-drive-without-making-the-file-available
- Forking this project, adding a file, and linking to the "raw" URL.
